# SakuraShell
SakuraShell â€“ a cutesy, customizable Linux-based OS with its own init system (SakuRC) and userland. Made for fun, daily use, and learning.

# About

SakuraShell is a silly little distro I made out of boredom. It has its own init system and themed userspace, as well as custom commands ect.
I started this project on september 24th 2025 because Linux, especially Gentoo has been my daily driver for around 7 years now, and I think
now is the perfect time to start a new, big project and create my own distro! >w<

# Infos

- This is a veeeeeeery big project and because of school, stress and mental health, this is going to take a shit ton of time...
- I don't know how much longer it is going to take, but I'll release the first version ASAP once I get the base to work :s
